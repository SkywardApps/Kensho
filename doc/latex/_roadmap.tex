\item[\hyperlink{todo__todo000001}{Todo}]thoughts
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item if-\/then-\/else or case method in lua, since we can't use the 'if' logic or looping at all in the current declaration code.
\item version of 'observe' that takes a whitelist of attributes to track, so we don't wrap methods we don't care about (performance)
\item version of Ken\+Model that can use internal dispatch rather than just using the tracker. This may be a faster method than constantly getting the attached object. Could still use K\+V\+O, or even just a system where the object itself notifies the dispatcher
\item two-\/way bindings
\item method or selector bindings. Ie, what happens when you click a button? Could even inline lua to execute?
\item integrate lua more directly. Maybe a static executor? Then we have a scripting engine available anywhere.
\item How do we do templating? Do we even want to?
\item How to we bind to collections better, and get add/remove/move events? K\+V\+O supports this, and foreach could use it pretty effectively.
\item Do we need other layout bindings, like 'grid'? Or are things like 'space before' 'space after' space between' sufficient?
\item Tests
\item Documentation
\item Auto-\/doxygen
