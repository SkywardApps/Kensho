Top level overview of how the project is organized and structured. Kickof into specific class documentation.

Attached dictionary for binding to values in interface builder Lua for scripting computed values. Dependencies tracked by evaluating computed while tracking is on. This means you can circumvent if you aren't careful. Arrays are observables with additional support for collection tracking. Try to abstract both arrays and dictionaries as key -\/$>$ value Bindings are done by class and 'name'.

Topics to cover in architecture, in order of descent into madness
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Kensho object \& context
\item Lua Wrapper
\item Bindings \& Ken category method
\item Use in Interface Builder
\item Tracker \& observe\+: category method
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Internal attribute tracking
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Only tracks K\+V\+C compliant attributes
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Swizzleing per class
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Swizzles for everyone! Performance issue!
\item Swizzles all parents! Except N\+S\+Object
\item Block created per method for 'type safety'
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Dependency Tracking via ken
\item Change propogation
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Computed
\item Observable\+Value for Parity
\item Ken\+Model for convenience
