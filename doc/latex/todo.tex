\item if-\/then-\/else or case method in lua, since we can't use the 'if' logic or looping at all in the current declaration code.
\item version of 'observe' that takes a whitelist of attributes to track, so we don't wrap methods we don't care about (performance)
\item version of Ken\+Model that can use internal dispatch rather than just using the tracker. This may be a faster method than constantly getting the attached object. Could still use K\+V\+O, or even just a system where the object itself notifies the dispatcher
\item two-\/way bindings
\item method or selector bindings. Ie, what happens when you click a button? Could even inline lua to execute?
\item integrate lua more directly. Maybe a static executor? Then we have a scripting engine available anywhere.
\item How do we do templating? Do we even want to?
\item How to we bind to collections better, and get add/remove/move events? K\+V\+O supports this, and foreach could use it pretty effectively.
\item Do we need other layout bindings, like 'grid'? Or are things like 'space before' 'space after' space between' sufficient?
